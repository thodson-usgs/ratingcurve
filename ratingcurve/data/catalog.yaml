                # Chalk Creek at Coalville, UT (section control)

                ## USGS Gage ID: 10131000
                
                ## Control
                The streambed is composed of gravel, sand, and silt.
                The channel is straight for 150 feet above the gage and 100 feet below the station.
                The banks are fairly steep through the gage reach, especially the left bank.
                The right bank is fairly protected from erosion due to an abundance of willow and cottonwood trees that grow along the bank.
                A concrete Ogee weir is the hydraulic control for all but the highest of flows which are under channel control.

                # Colorado River at Potash, UT (channel control)

                ## USGS Gage ID: 09185600
                
                ## Control
                The stream reach is in an incised river canyon in sandstone and mudstone. 
                Channel control is in affect at all stages. 
                A sharp bend of the river is present just upstream of the gage. 
                The channel is straight for about 1,000 ft downstream before it begins a broad bend to the right.
                
                ## Stage Ranges

                # Green River near Jensen, UT (channel control)
                
                ## USGS Gage ID: 09261000
                
                ## Control
                At the gage, the river is restricted to one channel at all stages.
                The streambed is very flat and is composed of cobbles.
                The banks consist of sand, gravel and cobbles.
                Riparian vegetation includes sage brush, willows, greasewood, and tamarisk.
                The left bank is not as steep as the right, which slopes up quite abruptly.
                Both banks are quite stable and are not subject to overflow except at extremely high stages.
                The channel is straight for several hundred yards upstream but bends sharply to the right about 2,000 feet below the station.
                Channel control prevails at all but the lowest stages when a rocky riffle 200 feet below the gage becomes effective.
                The riffle is quite stable. 
                
                ## Stage Ranges

                # Provo River near Woodland, UT (single offset)

                ## USGS Gage ID: 10154200
                
                ## Control
                The channel is fairly straight for about 300 feet above and 30 feet below gage where it starts to bend left.
                The streambed is composed of rounded cobbles and boulders, and the gradient is fairly steep in the vicinity of the gage.
                The low to medium flow control is a rocky riffle about 80 feet below the gage, and during high flow channel geometry becomes the control.
                Both banks are rather rocky with a slope of about 45 degrees and are generally not subject to overflow.
                Both section and channel controls present, but due to channel roughness and slope a single straight-line rating segment 
                (single offset) represents the stage discharge relation for both controls.
                This is common in high gradient cobble or larger substrate streams.

  simulated rating:

                # Simulated 3 segment rating (section, channel, and overbank controls)

                ## Control
                A synthetic compound channel was developed for the purposes of simulating streamflows to develop a theoretically defined rating curve.
                The rectangular main channel is 100 feet wide and 5 feet tall. A section control resembling a obtuse angled weir roughly 0.3 ft above 
                the main channel bed was inserted downstream of the gaged cross section. 
                Floodplains on either side were each 715 ft wide.
                
                ## Stage Ranges
                - Section control: 5.0 to 5.75 ft
                - Channel control: 5.75 to 10 ft
