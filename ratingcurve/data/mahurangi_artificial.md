# Mahurangi River at College, New Zealand

## Control

The station is equipped with a 90°, 600 mm-high V-notch weir nested within a
wider triangular weir with a wing slope of 1:10. The official rating curve
follows a three-segment model. The data source does not describe the stage for
each transistion.

For each gauging, the expected gauging uncertainty (±5% or ± 7%) was provided
based on the measurement method (acoustic Doppler current profiler or current
meter, respectively).

Stage and discharge in units of meters and m^3/s, respectively.
