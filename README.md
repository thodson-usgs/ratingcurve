# ratingcurve
*A Python library for fitting stage-discharge rating curves.*

Use `ratingcurve` to fit streamflow ratings with a segmented power law,
which is the the most common type rating model used by USGS.

The segmented power law is parameterized as:

$$
    \log(Q) = a + \sum_{i=1}^{n} b_i \log(x - x_{o,i}) H_i(x - x_{o,i})
$$

where
$Q$ is a vector discharge, \
$n$ is the number of breakpoints in the rating, \
$a$ and $b$ are model parameters, \
$x$ is a vector of stage observations, \
$x_o$ is a vector of breakpoints, and \
$H$ is the Heaviside function. 

In a standard linear model $b$ represents the slope of the function with respect the input.
In the segmented power law $b_o$ is the slope and each subsequent $b_i$ are adjustment to the base slope for each segment.

This library is for experimental purposes only.

## Installation
Install using pip
```sh
pip install ratingcurve
```
or conda
```sh
# acreate a new environment
conda create -n ratingcurve
conda activate ratingcurve
conda install -c conda-forge ratingcurve
# add environment to jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ratingcurve
```

## Getting Started
The [`segmented-power-law-demo.ipynb`](https://github.com/thodson-usgs/ratingcurve/blob/main/notebooks/segmented-power-law-demo.ipynb)
notebook demonstrates basic use of the package.
You can try it out in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/thodson-usgs/ratingcurve/blob/master/notebooks/segmented-power-law-demo.ipynb)

or locally using the environment created in the previous step
```sh
conda activate base # or your prefered jupyter lab environment
jupyter lab
```
then open the notebook and select the `ratingcurve` kernel that was installed earlier.

A simple example is given below.

```python
from ratingcurve.ratingmodel import SegmentedRatingModel

# load tutorial data
df = tutorial.open_dataset('green_channel')


# setup model
segments = 2

powerrating = SegmentedRatingModel(q=df['q'],
                                   h=df['stage'], 
                                   q_sigma=df['q_sigma'],
                                   segments=segments)
                                   
# fit model, then simulate the rating
with powerrating:
    mean_field = pm.fit(n=150_000)
    trace = mean_field.sample(5000)
    
powerrating.plot(trace)
```
